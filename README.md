# Shannon's MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The app is a React.js bookshelf that allows the users to search, select, and categorize books onto shelves, such as currently reading, want to read, and read. 

You are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Installation

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or use npm install and npm start to install and launch the application.

## Dependencies Used
* React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Yarn - A CLI client used to fetch modules from the npm registry.

## The Original Registry
The original registry from Udacity provided a backend API for book information.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

## Contributing

This repository was initially created from the starter code template for Udacity students.
